# Buffon's Needle

[Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem) on this popular 18th century problem.

## Goal
- Find the probability function in the case that l > t
- Use Monte Carlo simulation to find the probability in the case that l < t
- Use Monte Carlo simulation to find the probability in the case that t < l
- Visualize Monte Carlo simulation against the analytic plot.
